# 4-2 Parameter-passing costs

> Throughout this book, we assume that parameter passing during procedure calls takes constant time, even if an N -element array is being passed. This assumption is valid in most systems because a pointer to the array is passed, not the array itself. This problem examines the implications of three parameter-passing strategies:
>
> 1. Arrays are passed by pointer. Time $= \Theta(1)$.
>
> 2. Arrays are passed by copying. Time $=\Theta(1)$, where $N$ is the size of the array.
>
> 3. Arrays are passed by copying only the subrange that might be accessed by the called procedure. Time $=\Theta(n)$ if the subarray contains $n$ elements.
>
> Consider the following three algorithms:
>
> **a**. The recursive binary-search algorithm for finding a number in a sorted array(see Exercise 2.3-6).
>
> **b**. The MERGE-SORT procedure from Section 2.3.1.
>
> **c**. The MATRIX-MULTIPLY-RECURSIVE procedure from Section 4.1.
>
> Give nine recurrences $T_{a1}(N,n),T_{a2}(N,n),\dots ,T_{c3}(T,n)$ for the worst-case running times of each of the three algorithms above when arrays and matrices are passed using each of the three parameter-passing strategies above. Solve your recurrences, giving tight asymptotic bounds.
