# 3-7 Iterated functions

> We can apply the iteration operator * used in the $\lg^{\ast}$ function to any monotonically increasing function $f(n)$ over the real. For a given constant $c \in \R$, we define the iterated dunction $f_{c}^{\ast}$ by
>
> $f_{c}^{\ast}=\min \lbrace i\geq0:f^{(i)}\leq c\rbrace$,
>
> which need not be well defined in all cases. In other words, the quantity $f_{c}^{\ast}(n)$ is the minimum number of iterated applications of the function $f$ required to reduce its argument down to $c$ or less.
>
> For each of the functions $f(n)$ and constants $c$ in the table below, give as tight a bound as possible on $f_{c}^{\ast}(n)$. If there is no $i$ such that $f^{(i)} \leq c$, write "undefined" as your answer.

| $f(n)$     | $c$  | $f_{c}^{\ast}(n)$ |
| :--------- | :--- | :------------- |
| $n-1$      | $0$  |     $\Theta(n)$           |
| $\lg n$    | $1$  |         $\Theta(\lg^{\ast}n)$       |
| $n/2$      | $1$  |        $\Theta(\lg n)$        |
| $n/2$      | $2$  |        $\Theta(\lg n)$        |
| $\sqrt{n}$ | $2$  |          $\theta(\lg\lg n)$      |
| $\sqrt{n}$ | $1$  |           undefined     |
| $n^{1/3}$  | $2$  |         $\Theta(\log_3\lg n)$       |
