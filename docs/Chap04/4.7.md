# $\star$ 4.7 Akra-Bazzi recurrences

## $\star$ 4.7-1

> Consider an Akra-Bazzi recurrence $T(n)$ on the reals as given in recurrence (4.22), and define $T'(n)$ as

> where $c > 0$ is constant. Prove that whatever the implicit initial conditions for T(n) might be, there exist initial conditions for $T'(n)$ such that $T'(n) = cT(n)$ for all $n>0$. Conclude that we can drop the asymptotics on a driving function in any Akra-Bazzi recurrence without affecting its asymptotic solution.

## 4.7-2

> Show that $f(n)=n^2$ satisfies the polynomial-growth condition but that $f(n)=2^n$ does not.

## 4.7-3

> Let f(n) be a function that satisfies the polynomial-growth condition. Prove that $f(n)$ is asymptotically positive, that is, there exists a constantis asymptotically positive, that is, there exists a constant $n_0\geq 0$ such that $f(n)\geq 0$ for all $n\geq n_0$.

## $\star$ 4.7-4

> Give an example of a function $f(n)$ that does not satisfy the polynomial-growth condition but for which $f(\Theta(n)) = \Theta(f(n))$.

## 4.7-5

> Use the Akra-Bazzi method to solve the following recurrences.
>
> **a**. $T(n) = T(n/2)+T(n/3)+T(n/6)+n\lg n$.
>
> **b**. $T(n) = 3T(n/3)+8T(n/4)+n^2/\lg n$.
>
> **c**. $T(n) = (2/3)T(n/3)+(1/3)T(2n/3)+\lg n$.
>
> **d**. $T(n) = (1/3)T(n/3) + 1/n$.
>
> **e**. $T(n) = 3T(n/3) + 3T(2n/3)+n^2$.

## $\star$ 4.7-6

> Use the Akra-Bazzi method to prove the continuous master theorem.
