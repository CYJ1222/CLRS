# 2-4 Inversions

> Let $A[1:n]$ be an array of n distinct numbers. If $i < j$ and $A[i] > A[j]$, then the pair $(i,j)$ is called an **inversion** of A.
>
> **a**. List the five inversions of the array $\langle 2,3,8,6,1 \rangle$.
>
> **b**. What array with elements from the set $\langle 1,2,\dots ,n \rangle$. has the most inversions? How many does it have?
>
> **c**. What is the relationship between the running time of insertion sort and the number of inversions in the input array? Justify your answer.
>
> **d**. Give an algorithm that determines the number of inversions in any permutation. on *n* elementa in $\Theta (n \lg n)$ worse-case time. (Hint: Modify merge sort.)

- **a**. (1,5),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)

- **b**. $\langle n,n-1,\dots ,1\rangle \text{ totally has } {n \choose 2} = n(n-1)/2 \text{ inversions}$

- **c**. The running time of insertsion sort is a constant times the number of inversions, since each time exchanging elements in insertion sort reduces Inversions num by 1.

- **d**.
